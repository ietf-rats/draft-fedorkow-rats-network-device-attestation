<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>There are many aspects to consider in fielding a trusted computing device,
from operating systems to applications.  Mechanisms to prove that
a device installed at a customer’s site is authentic (i.e., not counterfeit) and has
been configured with authorized software, all as part of a trusted supply chain, is one
of those aspects that’s easily overlooked.</t>

<t>Attestation is defined here as the process of creating, conveying and appraising
assertions about Platform trustworthiness characteristics, including supply chain trust,
identity, platform provenance, software configuration, hardware configuration, platform
composition, compliance to test suites, functional and assurance evaluations,
etc.</t>

<t>The supply chain itself has many elements, from validating suppliers of electronic
components, to ensuring that shipping procedures protect against tampering
through many stages of distribution and warehousing.  One element that helps
maintain the integrity of the supply chain after manufacturing is Attestation,
by assuring an administrator that the software that was launched when the device
was started is the same as the software that the device vendor initially shipped.</t>

<t>Within the Trusted Computing Group context, attestation is the process by
which an independent Verifier can obtain cryptographic proof as to the identity
of the device in question, evidence of the integrity of software loaded on
that device when it started up, and then verify that what’s there is what’s
supposed to be there.  For networking equipment, a verifier capability can
be embedded in a Network Management Station (NMS), a posture collection server,
or other network analytics tool (such as a software asset management solution,
or a threat detection and mitigation tool, etc.). While informally referred
to as attestation, this document focuses on a subset defined here as Remote
Integrity Verification (RIV).  RIV takes a network equipment centric perspective
that includes a set of protocols and procedures for determining whether a
particular device was launched with untampered software, starting from Roots
of Trust.  While there are many ways to accomplish attestation, RIV sets
out a specific set of protocols and tools that work in environments commonly
found in Networking Equipment.  RIV does not cover other platform characteristics
that could be attested, although it does provide evidence of a secure infrastructure
to increase the level of trust in other platform characteristics attested
by other means.</t>

<t>This profile outlines the RIV problem, and then identifies elements that
are necessary to get the complete attestation procedure working in a scalable
solution using commercial products.</t>

<t>This document focuses primarily on software integrity verification using
the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to ensure a trustworthy result.</t>

<t>The integrity of attestation information must be protected by means of cryptographic
techniques, to assure its validity.
It’s important to note that TCG technologies are available to use either symmetric
key encryption with shared keys, or public key cryptography using private/public key pairs.
The two techniques can each produce secure results, but do require different provisioning mechanisms.
The RIV document currently focuses on asymmetric keying approaches only; future work might
include techniques for attestation using symmetric keys.</t>

<section anchor="requirements-language" title="Requirements Language">
<t>This document is non-normative; the document does not define protocols,
but rather identifies existing protocols that can be used together to achieve the
goals above, and in some cases, highlights gaps in existing protocols.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goals" title="Goals">

<t>Attestation requires two interlocking services on the device:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Platform Identity, the mechanism providing trusted identity, can reassure network
managers that the specific devices they ordered from authorized manufacturers for
attachment to their network are those that were installed, and that they continue to
be present in their network. As part of the mechanism for Platform Identity,
cryptographic proof of the identity of the manufacturer is also provided.</t>
  <t>Software Measurement is the mechanism that reports the state of mutable software components
on the device, and can assure network managers that they have known, untampered
software configured to run in their network.</t>
</list></t>

<t>As a part of a trusted supply chain, the RIV attestation workflow outlined in this document is intended to meet the following high-level goals:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Provable Device Identity - The ability to identify a device using a cryptographic
identifier is a critical prerequisite to software inventory attestation.</t>
  <t>Software Inventory - A key goal is to identify the software release installed
on the device, and to provide evidence of its integrity.</t>
  <t>Verifiability - Verification of software and configuration of the device shows
that the software that’s supposed to be installed on  there actually has
been launched.  Verification  against reference
manifests signed by the supplier of the software provides assurance that the
software is free of unauthorized modification.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="description-of-remote-integrity-verification-riv" title="Description of Remote Integrity Verification (RIV)">

<t>RIV is a procedure that assures a network operator that the equipment on
their network can be reliably identified, and that untampered software of
a known version is installed on each endpoint. In this context, endpoint
might include the conventional connected devices like servers and laptops, but also
connected devices that make up the network equipment itself, such as routers,
switches and firewalls.</t>

<t>RIV can be viewed as a link in a trusted supply chain that ensures that devices launch
software without unauthorized modification, and includes three major processes:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Creation of Evidence is the process whereby an endpoint generates cryptographic
  proof (evidence) of claims about platform properties. In particular, the
  platform identity and its software configuration are of critical importance</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Platform Identity refers to the mechanism assuring the
attestation relying party (typically a network administrator)
of the identity of devices that make up their network,
and that their manufacturers are known.</t>
  <t>Software used to boot a platform can be described as a chain
of measurements, started by a Root of Trust for Measurement,
that normally ends when the system software is loaded.
A measurement signifies the identity, integrity and version of each
software component registered with the TPM, so that the
subsequent appraisal stage can determine if the software
installed is authentic, up-to-date, and free of tampering.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Clearly the
  second part of the problem, attesting the state of mutable components
  of a given device, is of little value without
  reliable identification of the device in question.  By the
  same token, unambiguous identity of a device is necessary,
  but is insufficient to assure the operator of the provenance
  of the device through the supply chain, or that the device is
  configured to behave properly.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Conveyance of Evidence is the process of reliably transporting evidence from
  the point in a connected device where a measurement is stored to an
  appraiser/verifier, e.g. a management station. The transport
  is typically carried out via a management network. The channel must provide
  integrity and authenticity, and, in some use cases, may also require confidentiality.</t>
  <t>Appraisal of Evidence is the process of verifying the evidence received by
  a verifier/appraiser from a device, and using verified evidence to inform
  decision making. In this context, verification means comparing the device
  measurements reported as evidence with the configuration expected by the
  system administrator. This step can work only when there is a way to express
  what should be there, often referred to as golden measurements, or Reference
  Integrity Measurements, representing the intended configured state of the
  connected device.</t>
</list></t>

<t>An implementation of RIV requires three technologies</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Identity: Platform identity can be based on IEEE 802.1AR Device Identity <xref target="IEEE-802-1AR"/>,
coupled with careful supply-chain management by the manufacturer.  The
DevID certificate contains a statement by the manufacturer that establishes
the provenance of the device as it left the factory.  Some applications with
a more-complex post-manufacture supply chain (e.g. Value Added Resellers),
or with different privacy concerns, may want to use an alternate mechanism for platform
authentication based on TCG Platform Certificates <xref target="Platform-Certificates"/>.
RIV currently relies on asymmetric keying for identity; alternate approaches
might use symmetric keys.</t>
  <t>Platform Attestation provides evidence of configuration of software elements
throughout the product lifecycle.  This form of attestation can be implemented
with TPM PCR, Quote and log mechanisms, which provide an authenticated mechanism
to report what software actually starts up on the device each time it reboots.</t>
  <t>Reference Integrity Measurements must be conveyed from the software authority
(often the manufacturer for embedded systems) to the system in which verification
will take place</t>
</list></t>

<t>Service Providers benefit from a trustworthy attestation mechanism that provides
assurance that their network comprises authentic equipment, and has loaded software
free of known vulnerabilities and unauthorized tampering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solution-requirements" title="Solution Requirements">

<t>The RIV attestation solution must meet a number of requirements to make it simple
to deploy at scale.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Easy to Use - This solution should work “out of the box” as far as possible,
that is, with the fewest possible steps needed at the end-user’s site.  Eliminate
complicated databases or provisioning steps that would have to be executed
by the owner of a new device. Network equipment is often required to “self-configure”,
to reliably reach out without manual intervention to prove its identity and
operating posture, then download its own configuration. See <xref target="RFC8572"/> for an
example of Secure Zero Touch Provisioning.</t>
  <t>Multi-Vendor - This solution should identify standards-based interfaces that
allow attestation to work with attestation-capable devices and verifiers
supplied by different vendors in one network.</t>
  <t>Scalable - The solution must not depend on choke points that limit the number
of endpoints that could be evaluated in one network domain.</t>
  <t>Extensible - A network equipment attestation solution needs to expand over
time as new features are added. The solution must allow new features to be
added easily, providing for a smooth transition and allowing newer and older
architectural components to continue to work together. Further, a network
equipment attestation solution and the specifications referenced here must
define safe extensibility mechanisms that enable innovation without breaking
interoperability.</t>
  <t>Efficient - A network equipment attestation solution should, to the greatest
extent feasible, continuously monitor the health and posture status of network
devices. Posture measurements should be updated in real-time as changes to
device posture occur and should be published to remote integrity validators.
Validation reports should also be shared with their relying parties (for
example, network administrators, or network analytics that rely on these
reports for posture assessment) as soon as they are available.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope" title="Scope">

<t>Remote Attestation is a very general problem that could apply to most network-connected computing devices.  However, this document includes several assumptions that limit the scope to Network Equipment (e.g. routers, switches and firewalls):</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>This solution is for use in non-privacy-preserving applications (for example,
networking, Industrial IoT), avoiding the need for a Privacy Certificate
Authority for attestation keys <xref target="AIK-Enrollment"/> or TCG Platform
Certificates <xref target="Platform-Certificates"/></t>
  <t>This document applies primarily to “embedded” applications, where the device
manufacturer ships the software image for the device.</t>
  <t>This document assumes network protocols that are common in networking equipment,
but not generally used in other applications.  Other applications (such as Industrial
IoT) would replace YANG/Netconf with a protocol suite more commonly used in
that environment.  Similarly, the same information flow would be used in Network
Endpoint Assessment <xref target="RFC5209"/>, mapped to NEA protocols.</t>
  <t>The approach outlined in this document assumes the use of TPM 1.2 or TPM 2.0.  Other
roots of trust could be used with the same information flow, although different
data structures would likely be called for.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="out-of-scope" title="Out of Scope">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Run-Time Attestation: Run-time attestation of Linux or other multi-threaded
operating system processes considerably expands the scope of the problem.
Many researchers are working on that problem, but this document defers the
run-time attestation problem.</t>
  <t>Multi-Vendor Embedded Systems: Additional coordination would be needed for
devices that themselves comprise hardware and software from multiple vendors,
integrated by the end user.  Although currently out of scope for RIV, Trusted
Computing Group specifications do
encompass attestation of multi-vendor endpoint computing devices.</t>
  <t>Processor Sleep Modes: Network equipment typically does not “sleep”, so
sleep and hibernate modes are not considered.  Although out of scope
for RIV, Trusted Computing Group specifications do encompass sleep and hibernate
states.</t>
  <t>Virtualization and Containerization:  These technologies are increasingly
used in Network equipment, but are not considered in this revision of the
document.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="why-remote-integrity-verification" title="Why Remote Integrity Verification?">

<t>Remote Integrity Verification can go a long way to solving the “Lying Endpoint”
problem, in which malicious software on an endpoint may both subvert the
intended function, and also prevent the endpoint from reporting its compromised
status.  Man-in-the Middle attacks are also made more difficult through a
strong focus on device identity</t>

<t>Attestation data can be used for asset management, vulnerability and compliance
assessment, plus configuration management.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="network-device-attestation-challenges" title="Network Device Attestation Challenges">

<t>There have been demonstrations of attestation using TPMs for years, accompanied
by compelling security reasons for adopting attestation. Despite this, the
technology has not been widely adopted, in part, due to the difficulties
in deploying TPM-based attestation. Some of those difficulties are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Standardizing device identity. Creating and using unique device identifiers
is difficult, especially in a privacy-sensitive environment.  But attestation
is of limited value if the operator is unable to determine which devices
pass attestation validation tests, and which fail. This problem is substantially
simplified for infrastructure devices like network equipment, where identity
can be explicitly coded using IEEE 802.1AR, but doing so relies on adoption
of 802.1AR <xref target="IEEE-802-1AR"/> by manufacturers and hardware system integrators.</t>
  <t>Standardizing attestation representations and conveyance. Interoperable remote
attestation has a fundamental dependence on vendors agreeing to a limited
set of network protocols commonly used in existing network equipment for
communicating attestation data. Network device
vendors will be slow to adopt the changes necessary to implement remote
attestation without a fully-realized plan for deployment.</t>
  <t>Interoperability. Networking equipment operates in a fundamentally multi-vendor
environment, putting additional emphasis on the need for standardized procedures
and protocols.</t>
  <t>Attestation evidence is complex. Operating systems used in larger embedded
devices are often multi-threaded, so the order of completion for individual
processes is non-deterministic.  While the hash of a specific component is
stable, once extended into a PCR, the resulting values are dependent on the
(non-deterministic) ordering of events, so there will never be a single known-good
value for some PCRs.  Careful analysis of event logs can provide proof that
the expected modules loaded, but it’s much more complicated than simply comparing
reported and expected digests, as collected in TPM Platform Configuration
Registers (PCRs).</t>
  <t>Software configurations can have seemingly infinite variability.  This problem
is nearly intractable on PC and Server equipment, where end users have unending
needs for customization and new applications.  However, embedded systems,
like networking equipment, are often simpler, in that there are fewer variations
and releases, with vendors typically offering fewer options for mixing and
matching.</t>
  <t>Standards-based mechanisms to encode and distribute Reference Integrity
Measurements, (i.e., expected values) are still in development.</t>
  <t>Software updates can be complex.  Even the most organized network operator
may have many different releases in their network at any given time, with
the result that there’s never a single digest or fingerprint that indicates
the software is “correct”; digests formed by hashing software modules on
a device can only show the correct combination of versions for a specific
device at a specific time.</t>
</list></t>

<t>None of these issues are insurmountable, but together, they’ve made deployment
of attestation a major challenge.  The intent of this document is to outline
an attestation profile that’s simple enough to deploy, while yielding enough
security to be useful.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="why-is-os-attestation-different" title="Why is OS Attestation Different?">

<t>Even in embedded systems, adding Attestation at the OS level (e.g. Linux
IMA, Integrity Measurement Architecture <xref target="IMA"/>) increases the number of objects to
be attested by one or two orders of
magnitude, involves software that’s updated and changed frequently, and introduces
processes that begin in unpredictable order.</t>

<t>TCG and others (including the Linux community) are working on methods and
procedures for attesting the operating system and application software, but
standardization is still in process.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="solution-outline" title="Solution Outline">

<section anchor="riv-software-configuration-attestation-using-tpm" title="RIV Software Configuration Attestation using TPM">

<t>RIV Attestation is a process for determining the identity of software running
on a specifically-identified device.  Remote Attestation is broken into two
phases, shown in Figure 1:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>During system startup, measurements (i.e., digests computed as fingerprints
of files) are extended, or cryptographically folded, into the TPM.  Entries
are also added to an informational log.  The measurement process generally
follows the Chain of Trust model used in Measured Boot, where each stage
of the system measures the next one, and extends its measurement into the TPM,
before launching it.</t>
  <t>Once the device is running and has operational network connectivity, a separate,
trusted server (called a Verifier in this document) can interrogate the network
device to retrieve the logs and a copy of the digests collected by hashing
each software object, signed by an attestation private key known only to
the TPM.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The result is that the Verifier can verify the device’s identity by checking
the certificate containing the TPM’s attestation public key, and can
validate the software that was launched by comparing digests in the log with
known-good values, and verifying their correctness by comparing with the
signed digests from the TPM.</t>

<t>It should be noted that attestation and identity are inextricably linked;
signed evidence that a particular version of software was loaded is of little
value without cryptographic proof of the identity of the device producing
the evidence.</t>

<t>In Step 1, measurements are “extended” into the TPM as processes start. In
Step 2, signed PCR digests are retrieved from the TPM for off-box analysis
after the system is operational.</t>

<section anchor="what-does-riv-attest" title="What Does RIV Attest?">

<t>TPM attestation is strongly focused around Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), but those registers are only vehicles for certifying attestation evidence.  The evidence itself is conveyed in log files (xref) which give the name and hash of each object to be attested.  These hashes are also extended into PCRs, where they can be retrieved in the form of a quote signed by a key known only to the TPM (xref).  The use of multiple PCRs serves only to provide some independence between different classes of object, so that one class of objects can be updated without changing the extended hash for other classes.  Although PCRs can be used for any purpose, this section outlines the objects that are conventionally attested with a TPM.</t>

<t>In general, PCRs are organized to independently attest three classes of object:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Code, i.e., instructions to be executed by a CPU.  To maintain a chain of trust, it’s important to measure every bit of code that’s run outside the root of trust.</t>
  <t>Configuration - Many devices offer numerous options controlled by non-volatile configuration variables which can impact the device’s security posture.  These settings may have vendor defaults, but often can be changed by administrators, who may want to verify via attestation that the settings they intend are still in place.</t>
  <t>Keys - Administrators may wish to verify via attestation that keys outside the Root of Trust have not be subject to unauthorized tampering.  (By definition, keys inside the root of trust can’t be verified independently)</t>
</list></t>

<t>The TCG PC Client Platform Firmware Profile Specification <xref target="PC-Client-BIOS-TPM-2.0"/> gives considerable detail on what is to be measured during the boot phase of a platform boot using a UEFI BOIS (www.uefi.org), but the goal is simply to measure every bit of code executed in the process of starting the device, along with any configuration information related to security posture.  Table XX summarizes the functions that are measured, and how they are allocated to PCRs.  It’s important to note that each PCR may contain results from dozens (or even thousands) of individual measurements.</t>

<t>TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 have a variety of rules separating the functions of identity
and attestation, allowing for use-cases where software configuration must
be attested, but privacy must be maintained.</t>

<t>To accommodate these rules, enforced inside the TPM, in an environment where
device privacy is not
normally a requirement, the TCG Guidance for Securing Network Equipment
<xref target="NetEq"/> suggests using separate keys for Identity (i.e., DevID) and
Attestation (i.e., signing a quote of the contents of the PCRs), but
provisioning an Initial Attestation
Key (IAK) and x.509 certificate that parallels the IDevID, with the same
device ID information as the IDevID certificate (i.e., the same Subject Name
and Subject Alt Name, even though the key pairs are different).  This allows
a quote from the device, signed by the IAK, to be linked directly to the
device that provided it, by examining the corresponding IAK certificate.</t>

<t>Inclusion of an IAK by a vendor does not preclude a mechanism whereby an
Administrator can define Local Attestation Keys (LAKs) if desired.</t>

<section anchor="riv-information-flow" title="RIV Information Flow">

<t>RIV workflow for networking equipment is organized around a simple use-case,
where a network operator wishes to verify the integrity of software installed
in specific, fielded devices.  This use-case implies several components:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A Device (e.g. a router or other embedded device, also known as an Attester)
  somewhere and the network operator wants to examine its boot state.</t>
  <t>A Verifier (which might be a network management station) somewhere separate
  from the Device that will retrieve the information and analyze it to pass
  judgment on the security posture of the device.</t>
  <t>A Relying Party, which has access to the Verifier to request attestation
  and to act on results.  Interaction between the Relying Party and the
  Verifier is considered out of scope for RIV.</t>
  <t>Signed Reference Integrity Manifests (RIMs)
  (containing “golden measurements”, or Reference Integrity Measurements) can
  either be created by the device manufacturer
  and shipped along with the device as part of its software image, or alternatively,
  could be obtained a number of other ways (direct to the verifier from the
  manufacturer, from a third party, from the owner’s observation of what’s
  thought to be a “known good system”, etc.).  Retrieving RIMs from the device
  itself allows attestation to be done in systems which may not have access
  to the public internet, or by other devices that are not management stations
  per-se (e.g., a peer device).  If reference measurements are obtained from
  multiple sources, the Verifier may need to evaluate the relative level of
  trust to be placed in each source in case of a discrepancy.</t>
</list></t>

<t>These components are illustrated in Figure 2.</t>

<t>In Step 0, The Asserter (the device manufacturer) provides a Software Image
accompanied by one or more Reference Integrity Manifests (RIMs) to the Attester (the
device under attestation) signed by the asserter. In Step 1, the Verifier
(Network Management Station), on behalf of a Relying Party, requests Identity,
Measurement Values (and possibly RIMs) from the Attester. In Step 2, the
Attester responds to the request by providing a DevID, quotes (measured values),
and optionally RIMs, signed by the Attester.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="riv-simplifying-assumptions" title="RIV Simplifying Assumptions">

<t>This document makes the following simplifying assumptions to reduce complexity:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The product to be attested is shipped with an IEEE 802.1AR DevID and an Initial
Attestation Key (IAK) with certificate.  The IAK cert contains the same identity
information as the DevID (specifically, the same Subject Name and Subject
Alt Name, signed by the manufacturer), but it’s a type of key that can be
used to sign a TPM Quote.  This convention is described in TCG Guidance for
Securing Network Equipment <xref target="NetEq"/>. For network equipment, which is generally non-privacy-sensitive, shipping
a device with both an IDevID and an IAK already provisioned substantially
simplifies initial startup. Privacy-sensitive applications may use the TCG
Platform Certificate and additional procedures to install identity credentials
on the platform after manufacture.  (See Section 2.3.1 below for the Platform
Certificate alternative)</t>
  <t>The product is equipped with a Root of Trust for Measurement, Root of Trust
for Storage and Root of Trust for Reporting (as defined in <xref target="GloPlaRoT"/>) that are
capable of conforming to the TCG Trusted Attestation Protocol (TAP) Information Model <xref target="TAP"/>.</t>
  <t>The vendor will ship Reference Integrity Measurements (i.e., known-good measurements)
in the form of signed CoSWID tags <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid"/>, <xref target="SWID"/>,
as described in TCG Reference Integrity Measurement Manifest Information Model <xref target="RIM"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="devid-alternatives" title="DevID Alternatives">

<t>Some situations may have privacy-sensitive requirements that preclude shipping
every device with an Initial Device ID installed.  In these cases, the IDevID
can be installed remotely using the TCG Platform Certificate <xref target="Platform-Certificates"/>.</t>

<t>Some administrators may want to install their own identity
credentials to certify device identity and attestation results.  IEEE 802.1AR
<xref target="IEEE-802-1AR"/> allows for both Initial Device Identity credentials, installed by the manufacturer, (analogous to a physical serial number plate),
or Local Device Identity credentials installed by the administrator of the
device (analogous to the physical Asset Tag used by many enterprises to identify their property).  TCG TPM 2.0 Keys documents <xref target="Platform-DevID-TPM-2.0"/> and
<xref target="PC-Client-BIOS-TPM-2.0"/> specifies parallel Initial and Local Attestation Keys (IAK and LAK), and
contains figures showing the relationship between IDevID, LDevID, IAK and
LAK keys.</t>

<t>Device administrators are free to use any number of criteria to judge authenticity
of a device before installing local identity keys, as part of an on-boarding
process.  The TCG TPM 2.0 Keys document <xref target="Platform-DevID-TPM-2.0"/> also outlines
procedures for creating Local Attestation Keys and Local Device
IDs (LDevIDs) rooted in the manufacturer’s IDevID as a check to reduce the
chances that counterfeit devices are installed in the network.</t>

<t>Note that many networking devices are expected to self-configure (aka Zero
Touch Provisioning).  Current standardized zero-touch mechanisms such as
<xref target="RFC8572"/> assume that identity keys are already in place before network on-boarding
can start, and as such, are compatible with IDevID and IAK keys installed by the
manufacturer, but not with LDevID and LAK keys, which would have to be installed
by the administrator.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="additional-attestation-of-platform-characteristics" title="Additional Attestation of Platform Characteristics">

<t>The Platform Attribute Credential <xref target="Platform-Certificates"/> can also be used to convey
additional information about a platform from the
manufacturer or other entities in the supply chain.  While outside the scope
of RIV, the Platform Attribute Credential can deliver information such as
lists of serial numbers for components embedded in a device or security assertions
related to the platform, signed by the manufacturer, system integrator or
value-added-reseller.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="root-of-trust-for-measurement" title="Root of Trust for Measurement">

<t>The measurements needed for attestation require that the device being attested
is equipped with a Root of Trust for Measurement, i.e., some trustworthy
mechanism that can compute the first measurement in the chain of trust required
to attest that each stage of system startup is verified, and a Root of Trust
for Reporting to report the results <xref target="TCGRoT"/>, <xref target="GloPlaRoT"/>.</t>

<t>While there are many complex aspects of a Root of Trust, two aspects that
are important in the case of attestation are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The first measurement computed by the Root of Trust for Measurement, and stored
in the TPM’s Root of Trust for Storage, is presumed to be correct.</t>
  <t>There must not be a way to reset the RTS without re-entering the RTM code.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The first measurement must be computed by code that is implicitly trusted; if that
first measurement can be subverted, none of the remaining measurements can
be trusted. (See <xref target="NIST-SP-800-155"/>)</t>

</section>
<section anchor="reference-integrity-manifests-rims" title="Reference Integrity Manifests (RIMs)">

<t>Much of attestation focuses on collecting and transmitting evidence in
the form of PCR measurements and attestation logs.  But the critical part
of the process is enabling the verifier to decide whether the measurements
are “the right ones” or not.</t>

<t>While it must be up to network administrators to decide what they want on
their networks, the software supplier should supply the Reference Integrity
Measurements, (aka Golden Measurements or “known good” digests) that
may be used by a verifier to determine if evidence shows known good, known
bad or unknown software configurations.</t>

<t>In general, there are two kinds of reference measurements:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Measurements of early system startup (e.g., BIOS, boot loader, OS kernel)
are essentially single threaded, and executed exactly once, in a known sequence,
before any results could be reported.  In this case, while the method for
computing the hash and extending relevant PCRs may be complicated, the net
result is that the software (more likely, firmware) vendor will have one
known good PCR value that “should” be present in the relevant PCRs after the box has
booted.  In this case, the signed reference measurement could simply list the
expected hashes for the given version.  However, a RIM that contains the
intermediate hashes can be useful in debugging cases where the expected final hash
is not the one reported.</t>
  <t>Measurements taken later in operation of the system, once an OS has started
(for example, Linux IMA<xref target="IMA"/>), may be more complex, with unpredictable “final”
PCR values.  In this case, the Verifier must have enough information to reconstruct
the expected PCR values from logs and signed reference measurements from
a trusted authority.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In both cases, the expected values can be expressed as signed SWID or CoSWID tags,
but the SWID structure in the second case is somewhat more complex, as reconstruction of the extended hash in a PCR may involve thousands of files and other objects.</t>

<t>The TCG has published an information model defining elements of reference integrity
manifests under the title TCG Reference Integrity Manifest Information Model <xref target="RIM"/>.  This information model outlines how SWID tags should be structured to allow attestation, and defines “bundles” of SWID tags that may be needed to describe a complete software release.  The RIM contains some metadata relating to the software release it belongs to, plus hashes for each individual file or other object that could be attested.</t>

<t>TCG has also published the PC Client Reference Integrity Measurement specification <xref target="PC-Client-RIM"/>, which focuses on a SWID-compatible format suitable for expressing expected measurement values in the specific case of a UEFI-compatible BIOS, where the SWID focus on files and file systems is not a direct fit.  While the PC Client RIM is not directly applicable to network equipment, many vendors do use a conventional UEFI BIOS to launch their network OS.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="attestation-logs" title="Attestation Logs">

<t>Quotes from a TPM can provide evidence of the state of a device up to the time
the evidence was recorded, but to make sense of the quote in most cases an
event log of what software modules contributed which values to the quote
during startup must also be provided.  The log must contain enough information
to demonstrate its integrity by allowing exact reconstruction of the digest
conveyed in the signed quote (e.g., PCR values).</t>

<t>TCG has defined several event log formats:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>UEFI BIOS event log (TCG EFI Platform Specification for TPM Family 1.1 or
1.2, Section 7 <xref target="EFI-TPM"/>)</t>
  <t>Canonical Event Log <xref target="Canonical-Event-Log"/></t>
  <t>There is also a Legacy BIOS event log, although this document is less relevant as UEFI
has largely replaced the Legacy BIOS (TCG PC Client Specific Implementation Specification
for Conventional BIOS, Section 11.3<xref target="PC-Client-BIOS-TPM-1.2"/>)</t>
</list></t>

<t>It should be noted that a given device might use more than one event log
format (e.g., a UEFI log during initial boot, switching to Canonical Log
when the host OS launches).</t>

<t>The TCG SNMP Attestation MIB <xref target="SNMP-Attestation-MIB"/> will support any
record-oriented log format, including the three TCG-defined
formats, but it currently leaves figuring out which log(s) are in what format
up to the Verifier.</t>

<section anchor="riv-workflow" title="RIV Workflow">

<t>The overall flow for an attestation session is shown in Figure 4.  In this
diagram:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Step 0, obtaining the signed reference measurements, may happen in two
ways:</t>
  <t>Step 0A below shows a verifier obtaining reference measurements directly
from a software configuration authority, whether it’s the vendor or another
authority chosen by the system administrator.  The reference measurements
are signed by the Asserter (i.e., the software configuration authority).</t>
  <t>- Or - Step 0B, the reference measurements, signed by the Asserter, may be
distributed as part of software installation, long before the attestation
session begins.  Software installation is usually vendor-dependent, so there
are no standards involved in this step.  However, the verifier can use the
same protocol to obtain the reference measurements from the device as it
would have used with an external reference authority</t>
  <t>In Step 1, the Verifier initiates an attestation session by opening a TLS
session, validated using the DevID to prove that the connection is attesting
the right box.</t>
  <t>In Step 2, measured values are retrieved from the Attester’s TPM using a
YANG <xref target="RFC8348"/> or SNMP <xref target="RFC3413"/> interface that implements the TCG TAP model (e.g. YANG Module
for Basic Challenge-Response-based Remote Attestation Procedures <xref target="I-D.birkholz-yang-basic-remote-attestation"/>).</t>
  <t>In Step 3, the Attester also delivers a copy of the signed reference measurements,
using Software Inventory YANG module based on Software Identifiers <xref target="I-D.birkholz-yang-swid"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>These steps yield enough information for the Verifier to verify measurements against
reference values.  Of course, in all cases, the signatures protecting quotes and RIMs must be checked
before the contents are used.</t>

<t>Either CoSWID-encoded reference measurements are signed by a trusted authority
and retrieved directly prior to attestation (as shown in Step 0A), or CoSWID-encoded
reference measurements are signed by the device manufacturer, installed on
the device by a proprietary installer, and delivered during attestation (as
shown in Step 0B). In Step 1, the Verifier initiates a connection for attestation.
The Attester’s identity is validated using DevID with TLS. In Step 2, a
nonce, quotes (measured values) and measurement log are conveyed via TAP
with a protocol-specific binding (e.g. SNMP). Logs are sent in the Canonical
Log Format In Step 3, CoSWID-encoded reference measurements are retrieved
from the Attester using the YANG (<xref target="I-D.birkholz-yang-swid"/>.

<t>IETF documents are captured in boxes surrounded by asterisks. TCG documents
are shown in boxes surrounded by dots. The IETF Attestation Reference Interaction
Diagram, Reference Integrity Manifest, TAP Information Model
and Canonical Log Format, and both YANG modules are works in progress. Information
Model layers describe abstract data objects that can be requested, and the
corresponding response SNMP is still widely used, but the industry is transitioning
to YANG, so in some cases, both will be required. TLS Authentication with
TPM has been shown to work; SSH authentication using TPM-protected keys is
not as easily done [as of 2019]</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">

<t>Networking Equipment such as routers, switches and firewalls has a key role to play in guarding the privacy of individuals using the network:
* Packets passing through the device must not be sent to unauthorized destinations.  For example
  * Routers often act as Policy Enforcement Points, where individual subscribers may be checked for
  authorization to access a network.  Subscriber login information must not be released to unauthorized parties.
  * Networking Equipment is often called upon to block access to protected resources, or from unauthorized users.
* Routing information, such as the identity of a router’s peers, must not be leaked to unauthorized neighbors.
* If configured, encryption and decryption of traffic must be carried out reliably, while protecting keys and credentials.
Functions that protect privacy are implemented as part of each layer of hardware and software that
makes up the networking device.
In light of these requirements for protecting the privacy of users of the network, the Network Equipment
must identify itself, and its boot configuration and measured device state (for example, PCR values),
to the Equipment’s Administrator, so there’s no uncertainty as to what function each device and
configuration is configured to carry out . This allows the administrator to ensure that the network
provides individual and peer privacy guarantees.</t>

<t>RIV specifically addresses the collection information from enterprise network devices by an enterprise
network.  As such, privacy is a fundamental concern for those deploying this solution, given EU
GDPR, California CCPA, and many other privacy regulations.  The enterprise should implement
and enforce their duty of care.</t>

<t>See <xref target="NetEq"/> for more context on privacy in networking devices</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Attestation results from the RIV procedure are subject to a number of attacks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Keys may be compromised</t>
  <t>A counterfeit device may attempt to impersonate (spoof) a known authentic device</t>
  <t>Man-in-the-middle attacks may be used by a counterfeit device to attempt to deliver
responses that originate in an actual authentic device</t>
  <t>Replay attacks may be attempted by a compromised device</t>
</list></t>

<t>Trustworthiness of RIV attestation depends strongly on the validity of keys used for identity
and attestation reports.  RIV takes full advantage of TPM capabilities to ensure that results can be trusted.</t>

<t>Two sets of keys are relevant to RIV attestation</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A DevID key is used to certify the identity of the device in which the TPM is installed.</t>
  <t>An Attestation Key (AK) key signs attestation reports, (called ‘quotes’ in TCG documents),
used to provide evidence for integrity of the software on the device.</t>
</list></t>

<t>TPM practices require that these keys be different, as a way of ensuring that a general-purpose
signing key cannot be used to spoof an attestation quote.</t>

<t>In each case, the private half of the key is known only to the TPM, and cannot be
retrieved externally, even by a trusted party.  To ensure that’s the case,
specification-compliant private/public key-pairs are generated inside the TPM, where they’re never
exposed, and cannot be extracted (See <xref target="Platform-DevID-TPM-2.0"/>).</t>

<t>Keeping keys safe is just part of attestation security; knowing which keys are bound
to the device in question is just as important.</t>

<t>While there are many ways to manage keys in a TPM (See <xref target="Platform-DevID-TPM-2.0"/>), RIV includes
support for “zero touch” provisioning (also known as zero-touch onboarding) of fielded
devices (e.g. Secure ZTP, <xref target="RFC8572"/>}), where keys which have predictable trust properties are
provisioned by the device vendor.</t>

<t>Device identity in RIV is based on IEEE 802.1AR DevID. This specification provides several elements</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A DevID requires a unique key pair for each device, accompanied by an x.509 certificate</t>
  <t>The private portion of the DevID key is to be stored in the device, in a manner that provides confidentiality (Section 6.2.5 <xref target="IEEE-802-1AR"/>)</t>
</list></t>

<t>The x.509 certificate contains several components</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The public part of the unique DevID key assigned to that device</t>
  <t>An identifying string that’s unique to the manufacturer of the device.  This is normally the
serial number of the unit, which might also be printed on label on the device.</t>
  <t>The certificate must be signed by a key traceable to the manufacturer’s root key.</t>
</list></t>

<t>With these elements, the device’s manufacturer and serial number can be identified by analyzing the
DevID certificate plus the chain of intermediate certs leading back to the manufacturer’s root
certificate.  As is conventional in TLS connections, a nonce must be signed by the device
in response to a challenge,
proving possession of its DevID private key.</t>

<t>RIV uses the DevID to validate a TLS connection to the device as the attestation session begins.  Security of
this process derives from TLS security, with the DevID providing proof that the TLS session terminates on
the intended device. <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>Evidence of software integrity is delivered in the form of a quote signed by the TPM
itself.  Because the contents of the quote are signed inside the TPM, any external
modification (including reformatting to a different data format) will be detected
as tampering.</t>

<t>A critical feature of the YANG model described in <xref target="I-D.birkholz-yang-basic-remote-attestation"/> is the ability to carry TPM data structures in their native format, without requiring any changes to the structures as they were signed and delivered by the TPM.  While alternate methods of conveying TPM quotes could add an additional layer of signing using external keys, the important part is to preserve the TPM signing, so that tampering anywhere in the path between the TPM itself and the Verifier can be detected.</t>

<t>Prevention of spoofing attacks against attestation systems is also important.  There are two cases to consider:
* The entire device could be spoofed, that is, when the Verifier goes to verify a specific device, it might be redirected to a different device.  Use of the 802.1AR identity in the TPM ensures that the Verifier’s TLS session is in fact terminating on the right device.
* A compromised device could respond with a spoofed attestation result, that is, a compromised OS could return a fabricated quote.</t>

<t>Protection against spoofed quotes from a device with valid identity is a bit more complex.
An identity key must be available to sign any kind of nonce or hash offered by the verifier,
and consequently, could be used to sign a fabricated quote.  To block spoofed attestation
result, the quote generated inside the TPM must by signed by
a key that’s different from the DevID, called an Attestation Key (AK).</t>

<t>Given separate Attestation and DevID keys, the
binding between the AK and the same device must also be proven to
prevent a man-in-the-middle attack (e.g. the ‘Asokan Attack’ <xref target="RFC6813"/>).</t>

<t>This is accomplished in RIV through use of an AK certificate with the same elements as the DevID
(i.e., same manufacturer’s serial number, signed by the same manufacturer’s key), but containing
the device’s unique AK public key instead of the DevID public key.
[this will require an OID that says the key is known by the CA to be an Attestation key]</t>

<t>These two keys and certificates are used together:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The DevID is used to validate a TLS connection terminating on the device with a known serial number.</t>
  <t>The AK is used to sign attestation quotes, providing proof that the attestation
evidence comes from the same device.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Replay attacks, where results of a previous attestation are submitted in response to subsequent requests,
are usually prevented by inclusion of a nonce in the request to the TPM
for a quote.  Each request from the Verifier includes a new random number (a nonce). The resulting
quote signed by the TPM contains the same nonce, allowing the verifier to determine
freshness, i.e., that the resulting quote was generated in response to the verifier’s specific request.
Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation <xref target="I-D.birkholz-rats-tuda"/> provides an alternate mechanism
to verify freshness without requiring a request/response cycle.</t>

<t>Requiring results of attestation of the operating software to be signed by a key known only to the TPM also
removes the need to trust the device’s operating software (beyond the first measurement; see below); any
changes to the quote, generated and signed by the TPM itself, made by malicious device software, or in
the path back to the verifier, will invalidate the signature on the quote.</t>

<t>Although RIV recommends that device manufacturers pre-provision devices with easily-verified DevID and AK certs,
use of those credentials is not mandatory.  IEEE 802.1AR incorporates the idea of an Initial Device ID
(IDevID), provisioned by the manufacturer, and a Local Device ID (LDevID) provisioned by the owner of
the device.  RIV extends that concept by defining an Initial Attestation Key (IAK) and Local Attestation
Key (LAK) with the same properties.</t>

<t>Device owners can use any method to provision the Local credentials.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>TCG doc <xref target="Platform-DevID-TPM-2.0"/> shows how the initial Attestation
keys can be used to certify LDevID and LAK keys.  Use of the LDevID and LAK allows the device owner
to use a uniform identity structure across device types from multiple manufacturers (in the same way
that an “Asset Tag” is used by many enterprises use to identify devices they own).  TCG doc
<xref target="Provisioning-TPM-2.0"/> also contains guidance on provisioning identity keys in TPM 2.0.</t>
  <t>But device owners can use any other mechanism they want to assure themselves that Local identity
certificates are inserted into the intended device, including physical inspection and programming
in a secure location, if they prefer to avoid placing trust in the manufacturer-provided keys.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Clearly, Local keys can’t be used for secure Zero Touch provisioning; installation of the Local keys
can only be done by some process that runs before the device is configured for network operation.</t>

<t>On the other end of the device life cycle, provision should be made to wipe Local keys when a device
is decommissioned, to indicate that the device is no longer owned by the enterprise.  The manufacturer’s
Initial identity keys must be preserved, as they contain no information that’s not already printed on
the device’s serial number plate.</t>

<t>In addition to trustworthy provisioning of keys, RIV depends on other trust anchors.  (See <xref target="GloPlaRoT"/> for definitions of Roots of Trust.)</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Secure identity depends on mechanisms to prevent per-device secret keys from being compromised.  The TPM
provides this capability as a Root of Trust for Storage</t>
  <t>Attestation depends on an unbroken chain of measurements, starting from the very first measurement.
That first measurement is made by code called the Root of Trust for Measurement, typically done by trusted
firmware stored in boot flash.  Mechanisms for maintaining the trustworthiness of the RTM are out of
scope for RIV, but could include immutable firmware, signed updates, or a vendor-specific hardware
verification technique.</t>
  <t>RIV assumes some level of physical defense for the device.  If a TPM that has already been programmed
with an authentic DevID is stolen and inserted into a counterfeit device, attestation of that counterfeit
device may become indistinguishable from an authentic device.</t>
</list></t>

<t>RIV also depends on reliable reference measurements, as expressed by the RIM <xref target="RIM"/>.  The definition of
trust procedures for RIMs is out of scope for RIV, and the device owner is free to use any policy to validate
a set of reference measurements.  RIMs may be conveyed out-of-band or in-band, as part of the attestation
process (see Section 3.2).  But for embedded devices, where software is usually shipped as a self-contained
package, RIMs signed by the manufacturer and delivered in-band may be more convenient for the device owner.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">

<t>TCG technologies can play an important part in the implementation of Remote
Integrity Verification.  Standards for many of the components needed for
implementation of RIV already exist:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Platform identity can be based on IEEE 802.1AR Device identity, coupled with
careful supply-chain management by the manufacturer.</t>
  <t>Complex supply chains can be certified using TCG Platform Certificates <xref target="Platform-Certificates"/></t>
  <t>The TCG TAP mechanism can be used to retrieve attestation evidence.  Work
is needed on a YANG model for this protocol.</t>
  <t>Reference Measurements must be conveyed from the software authority (e.g.,
the manufacturer) to the system in which verification will take place.  IETF
CoSWID work forms the basis for this, but new work is needed to create an
information model and YANG implementation.</t>

<abstract><t>This document defines the problem statement, scope, and protocol requirements between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) reference model.  NEA provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism to evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to the network.  The learned posture information can then be applied to a variety of compliance-oriented decisions.  The posture information is frequently useful for detecting systems that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection mechanisms such as: anti-virus and host-based firewall software.  In order to provide context for the requirements, a reference model and terminology are introduced.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document presents a technique to securely provision a networking device when it is booting in a factory-default state.  Variations in the solution enable it to be used on both public and private networks.  The provisioning steps are able to update the boot image, commit an initial configuration, and execute arbitrary scripts to address auxiliary needs.  The updated device is subsequently able to establish secure connections with other systems.  For instance, a device may establish NETCONF (RFC 6241) and/or RESTCONF (RFC 8040) connections with deployment-specific network management systems.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This documents defines the method and bindings used to conduct Time- based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) between two RATS (Remote ATtestation procedureS) Principals over the Internet.  TUDA does not require a challenge-response handshake and thereby does not rely on the conveyance of a nonce to prove freshness of remote attestation Evidence.  Conversely, TUDA enables the creation of Secure Audit Logs that can constitute Evidence about current and past operational states of an Attester.  As a prerequisite for TUDA, every RATS Principal requires access to a trusted and synchronized time-source. Per default, in TUDA this is a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) issuing signed Time Stamp Tokens (TST).</t></abstract>
